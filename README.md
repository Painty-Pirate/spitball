This is where I say things
<!---Long, long ago, in a galaxy not too far away, humans thrived.
These were a different breed of humans, ones in tune with the flows of energy in our universe.
They directed fields of forces by hand.
Many great spells were devised.
Some men abused their god-like powers of creation, creating many great and terrible beasts called "chimeras".
These chimeras were crafted for terrible purposes, and served them well.
Too well, even, for their creators, who they turned on and slaughtered.
That world's civilizations fell, and those who remained tasked themselves with retribution.--->
# axiom 1
sharing is caring
<!---Icarus began to channel. He held his hands aloft, and a fireball appeared between them. 
What he faced was too terrible for the kind of fireball that a pedestrian mage might channel, so he breathed deeply and steadied his nerve.
The monster skittered closer. 
Icarus could not yet see it beyond the light of his fire, but he could hear it. 
A million, no, a billion chitinous limbs dug into the dusted rock at the floor of the cave. 
The monster could sense his mana; the beast hungered for it.
The sun that Icarus held over his head continued to grow. 
He felt the force of his creation struggle to break free from where he constrained it; the sun pushed his hands apart, longing to escape.
Several spans in front of him, a horrific head appeared from the dark. 
Mandibles moved by instinct alone, longing to rip him to pieces. 
Antenna waved through the air, picking up the flow of energy towards the light that Icarus created.
Icarus doubted. 
He feared that what he held could not possibly overcome what was before him. 
The monster tasted his fear on the air, and rushed forward, assured of its victory.
In desperation, the boy poured all of his soul into his fire.
Icarus felt the energy between his hands change form. 
At the heart of the sun, reality warped. --->
# axiom 2
tools can be turned against their creators, accidentally or otherwise
<!---The boy's hands were drawn towards the sun, as though they both had suddenly changed into opposite magnetic poles.
The beast was given pause. 
Its antenna had never sensed the all-consuming flows that Icarus had inadvertently created in his panic.
Icarus felt more than just his hands drawn towards his fireball, now.
Although a normal fireball does draw some air into it, the winds that now swirled around him felt unnatural.
He felt lighter than he ever had before.
Air was vacating the beast's lair at an unprecedented rate; Icarus struggled to breathe within the vortex.
The beast seemed to sense this, too...for a moment, it weighed Icarus's fear against its own.--->
# axiom 3
fear and loathing are never far apart
<!---The chimera's flight response triggered; it struggled to turn itself around in the narrow cave, claws thrashing against any purchase they could find.
The ceiling of the lair started coming down.
Boulders the size of a man bounced harmlessly off of the monster's terrible shell.
Icarus saw it all happen, but didn't have time to consider the beast's fear.
Those boulders now rolled slowly towards him, picking up speed.
He needed to find a way to contain his own creation before he could slay the one before him.--->
# axiom 4
there are many ways that this story may end
<!---Is Icarus consumed?
Can Icarus provide an electric charge to his singularity and contain it with electric fields?
Does he provide this charge with a spin and contain the singularity within an arrangement of magnets?
Does he obliterate the mass with antimatter?
Does he invoke the nuclear forces, in ways that I fail to comprehend?
Does any of this even make sense?
Does it matter?--->
# axiom 5
cleanliness is next to...
<!---Humanity's story is still largely unwritten and we will continue our efforts to keep it that way, I am sure.
I will spit-ball these mad thoughts until someone deems me irredeemable. 
I will publish them, hidden in invisible comments.
It's more fun this way, but I pray that you don't play a game of CTF with my computer.
Prehaps this is hypocritical of me to ask.
If you do, please be merciful.
I'm not really sure what's going on here.--->
