Icarus began to channel. He held his hands aloft, and a fireball appeared between them. 
What he faced was too terrible for the kind of fireball that a pedistrian mage might channel, so he breathed deeply and steadied his nerve.
The monster skittered closer. 
Icarus could not yet see it beyond the light of his fire, but he could hear it. 
A million, no, a billion chitinous limbs dug into the dusted rock at the floor of the cave. 
The monster could sense his mana; the beast hungered for it.
The sun that Icarus held over his head continued to grow. 
He felt the force of his creation struggle to break free from where he constrained it; the sun pushed his hands apart, longing to escape.
Several spans in front of him, a horrific head appeared from the dark. 
Mandibles moved by instinct alone, longing to rip him to pieces. 
Antenna waved through the air, picking up the flow of energy towards the light that Icarus created.
Icarus doubted. 
He feared that what he held could not possibly overcome what was before him. 
The monster tasted his fear on the air, and rushed forward, assured of its victory.
In desperation, the boy poured all of his soul into his fire.
Icarus felt the energy between his hands change form. 
At the heart of the sun, reality warped. 
The boy's hands were drawn towards the sun, as though they both had suddenly warped into opposite magnetic poles.
The beast was given pause. 
Its antenna had never sensed the all-consuming flows that Icarus had inadvertently created in his panic.
